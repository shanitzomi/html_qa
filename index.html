<p>Tel Aviv, currently the center of HiTech in Israel, the most expensive and crowded city in the country.<br>A city with inadequate parking and heavy time-consuming traffic sharpen the need for relocation,<br> expansion and the creation of new centers around the country primarily in the North and South of the country.</p><br>
The benefits of living and working in the periphery (lower costs of living,<br> less traffic, tax benefits and above all a better quality of life) are well known.<br>Encouraging HiTech companies to establish themselves in these areas will create a stronger workforce and strengthen the area.<br>Recently a few companies started to make this move such as Intel in Beer Sheva, HiTech Parks in Ashkelon and also in the North. Its only the beginning.<br>

<p>The OR Movement, an organization which encourages growth in the south and north of the country,<br> has taken upon itself to build 3 centers around the country by 2048.<br></p><br>

<p><b>I do have a vision that the North and the South of Israel<br> will become flourishing centers of HiTech thus increasing the quality of life here through higher work opportunities for the current and future residents.</b></p><br>
